# mld-files-by-dune
Simple experiment of mld files generated by dune

If not provided, mld files are generated from package definition specially by dune.
This will be the file used to generate the entry page for the package.
This is the page that will be linked from the main package listing.
If you omit writing an ``index.mld``, dune will generate one with the entry
modules for your package. But this generated will not be installed.

# Reproduction
Assuming `dune` and `odoc` are installed, clone this repo and run `dune build @doc` to generate documentation for the packages. A `_build` directly will be created by dune at the project root. The `mld` files that will be created from packages definitions can be found in `mld-files-by-dune/_build/default/_doc/_mlds` and html files are in `mld-files-by-dune/_build/default/_doc/_html`.

Dune stores executed commands in the process of documentation generation in `log` file at the root of the `_build` directory.
